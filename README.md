Hi, I am @marvin-schmitt

I am a semanticist/pragmaticist. Currently, I am interested in and working on:

- conversation
- speech acts
- common ground
- particles like _okay_
- formal models of these phenomena

I am also interested in logic and mathematics.

Some random facts:
- I am a big fan of strength sports: currently working on my first 200kg conventional deadlift! (currently at 180kg)
- I love metal music
- Working on my touch typing speed

I am currently studying _A shorter model theory_ by Wilfrid Hodges for my PhD thesis.

I am generally happy to collaborate on any of the above topics.

Best to reach me via email: _[firstnamelastname]linguistics[fancy a]gmail.com_
